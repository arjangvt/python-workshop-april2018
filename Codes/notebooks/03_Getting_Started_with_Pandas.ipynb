    "# Pandas DataFrame\n",
    "\n",
    "Numpy arrays are a fantastic way to start to perform numerical computations in Python, but they aren't often the way that we think about data as data scientists.  We often think about data as 2-dimensional tables where each column represents another a that we are be interested in.  This is one of the reasons why Microsoft Excel is still so prevalent for looking at data.  It clearly and concisely (okay this point may be argued) organizes data for the user.  The `R` language mimics this structure with their dataframe objects. \n",
    "\n",
    "To emulate this data structure in Python, the `pandas` library provides the `DataFrame` object which is built upon `numpy.array` objects. Let's jump right into playing with some data and examine the Pandas `DataFrame` structure.  \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's read the iris data set into the notebook.\n",
    "\n",

    "We've already shown two great commands in pandas.  First the `pd.read_csv()` function.  The primary reason that we didn't get into file `i/o` in standard Python is because some of the packages for data science provide great functionality already.  The second command is the `DataFrame.head()` command.  This is similar to UNIX `head` command which reads the first few lines of a document.  Pandas comes fully stocked with commands to summarize DataFrames. \n",
    "\n",
    "Additionally, notice that pandas \"just works\" with the jupyter notebook.  Without having to type `print` as the last command, the notebook put the table into a nice formatting.  Pandas DataFrames are set up nicely to look pretty within Jupyter notebooks.\n",
